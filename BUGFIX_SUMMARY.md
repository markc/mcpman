# Bug Fix Summary: McpServerStatusWidget Health Check

## 🐛 Issue Identified
**Error:** `ArgumentCountError: Too few arguments to function App\Services\PersistentMcpManager::healthCheck(), 0 passed and exactly 1 expected`

**Location:** `app/Filament/Widgets/McpServerStatusWidget.php:43`

**Root Cause:** The `healthCheck()` method in `PersistentMcpManager` requires a `connectionId` parameter, but the widget was calling it without any arguments.

## ✅ Fix Implemented

### 1. **Updated McpServerStatusWidget.php**
- **Before:** `$healthCheck = $manager->healthCheck();`
- **After:** Iterate through all active connections and check each one individually
```php
$activeConnections = \App\Models\McpConnection::where('status', 'active')->get();
$healthChecks = [];

foreach ($activeConnections as $connection) {
    $healthChecks[$connection->name] = $manager->healthCheck((string)$connection->id);
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Widget Functionality**
- ✅ Added proper health checking for all active connections
- ✅ Added active connection count display
- ✅ Improved error handling for empty connection states
- ✅ Enhanced the widget view to display connection-specific health status

### 3. **Updated Widget View Template**
- ✅ Added "Active Connections" count display
- ✅ Enhanced health check results to show per-connection status
- ✅ Added proper handling for empty connection scenarios
- ✅ Improved visual indicators (Healthy/Unhealthy badges)

## 🧪 Testing Completed

### **Comprehensive Widget Tests Created:**
- ✅ **Basic widget functionality test** - Widget instantiation, mounting, rendering
- ✅ **Multiple connections health check test** - Proper handling of active/inactive connections
- ✅ **Error state handling test** - Graceful handling of zero connections

### **Test Results:**
```
McpServerStatusWidgetTest:
✓ widget loads server status correctly (12 assertions)
✓ widget handles health check with multiple connections
✓ widget handles error states

Phase2InterfaceEnhancementTest:
✓ All Phase 2 tests still passing (34 assertions)
```
